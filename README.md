# Freeny-Fights

This is an RPG game that I created using characters from Jason Freeny's awesome collection of toys.

### How it Works
   * When the game starts, choose a player by clicking on any character's picture. You will fight as that character for the rest of the game.
   * You must, then, defeat all of the remaining fighters.
   * Choose an opponent by clicking on that character's picture.
   * Once you select an opponent, you will now be able to attack your opponent!
   * As you attack your opponent, they will lose health points & so will you; as they will, instantly, counter attack. (Health points are displayed at the bottom of each character's picture.
   * Continue the attack until your opponent's HP is 0.
   * If/once you defeat your opponent, choose your next opponent by clicking on another picture.
   * If you defeat all the characters before your HP hits 0, you win! If not, you die.
   * Good luck & choose your player wisely!
